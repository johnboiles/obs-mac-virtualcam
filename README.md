# OBS (macOS) Virtual Camera 🎥

![Build](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/workflows/Build%20and%20(maybe)%20Release/badge.svg)

Creates a virtual webcam device from the output of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). Especially useful for streaming smooth, composited video into Zoom, Hangouts, Jitsi etc. Like [CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam) but for macOS.

This code was spun out of [this OBS Project RFC](https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/15) which was itself spun out of [this issue](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2568) from [@tobi](https://github.com/tobi). The goal is for this (or something with equivalent functionality) to eventually be merged into the core OBS codebase 🤞.

## Donating 💸

Consider sending some money in the direction of the [OBS Project](https://obsproject.com/contribute) via [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/obsproject/contribute), [Patreon](https://patreon.com/OBSProject), or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/obsproject). Obviously, without OBS, this plugin would not be very useful! Hugh "Jim" Bailey is OBS Project's full-time lead developer and project maintainer. This money helps him continue to work on OBS!

If, after you donate to the OBS Project, you also want to send some cash my way that's appreciated too! Feel free to [Buy Me a Coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/johnboiles) or [PayPal me](https://paypal.me/johnboiles).

## Known Issues

* Zoom prior to version 5.1.1 disabled virtual cameras by default. Please update to the latest (5.2.1 at time of writing) to re-enable virtual camera. Start the virtual camera before starting the Zoom application.
* Slack, Webex, Skype and probably some other applications have disabled virtual cameras by default via [application restrictions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com_apple_security_cs_disable-library-validation?language=objc). Check out [the wiki](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility) to see if your app is supported. Please [edit the wiki](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility/_edit) if you try other software that we should include in that list. In most cases you can work around these restrictions by [re-codesigning those applications](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility#apps-dont-allow-dal-plugins).
* Photo Booth and FaceTime do not support virtual cameras as of macOS 10.14 Mojave since they disallow loading any plugin that's not provided by Apple. Photo Booth can simply be duplicated and renamed (e.g. `Photo Booth copy`) and it will work. There is no known workaroud for FaceTime.
* You _may_ need to restart your computer after installing new versions of this plugin (not sure why 🤷‍♂️).

See also the open [issues](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/issues) for other reported issues. In case you need help or think you found a bug, see [this](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam#Discussion--Support).

## Installing

* Download and install the latest version of OBS from the [official website](https://obsproject.com).
* Download the latest `.pkg` installer on the [Releases page](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/releases)
* Run the `.pkg` installer (entering your password when required)
* If you're already running OBS, make sure to restart it.
* Restart any app that was running during the installation process that is supposed to pick up the camera.
* To start the virtual camera, go (in OBS) to `Tools`→`Start Virtual Camera`.

Your OBS video should now show up in the target app!
