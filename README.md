# OBS (macOS) Virtual Camera

![Release](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/workflows/Release/badge.svg)

Creates a virtual webcam device from the output of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/). Especially useful for streaming smooth, composited video into Zoom, Hangouts, Jitsi etc. Like [CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam](https://github.com/CatxFish/obs-virtual-cam) but for macOS.

This code was spun out of [this OBS Project RFC](https://github.com/obsproject/rfcs/pull/15) which was itself spun out of [this issue](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2568) from [@tobi](https://github.com/tobi). This was intended as a proof of concept to inform technical decisions in that RFC, but who knows, maybe it will be useful to you in its current state. The goal is for this (or something with equivalent functionality) to eventually be merged into the core OBS codebase ðŸ¤ž.

This is heavily based on [Apple's CoreMediaIO sample code](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/samplecode/CoreMediaIO/Introduction/Intro.html) which has been [modernized by @lvsti](https://github.com/lvsti/CoreMediaIO-DAL-Example) and on [CoreMediaIO Device Abstraction Layer (DAL) Minimal Example by @johnboiles](https://github.com/johnboiles/coremediaio-dal-minimal-example).

## Known Issues

### Plugin Bugs
* The virtual camera doesn't work with all programs. Check out [COMPATIBILITY.md](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/blob/master/COMPATIBILITY.md) to see if your app is supported.
* Can't click menu bar after program start [(OBS Issue #2678)](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/2678).  **NOTE:** This is not an issue with this plugin, but it does make it more difficult to turn on the Virtual Camera created by this plugin.
* DAL plugin unable to run because of codesigning issues (for example unable to see Virtual Camera in latest version of Zoom). See [issue #4](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/issues/4) for a workaround

### Common Problems (with local builds)
* `Failed to load 'en-US' text for module: 'obs-mac-virtualcam.so'`: If the virtual camera doesn't work, you might see this error. However, it is expected and not the problem. There might be another problem you didn't see.
* Build fails at `cmake .. && make -j`: In this case, simply repeat `cmake .. && make -j`.
* Error 2: At the end of the build, the terminal will say `make: *** [all] Error 2`. This is expected and not an error. If it says `Built target obs` a few lines above, your build has succeeded.

_If you still have problems running the virtual camera, see below._


## Discussion / Support

The official place for discussion and chat related to this plugin is in the `#plugins-and-tools` channel in the [OBS Studio Discord](https://discord.gg/obsproject). 
For questions regarding build fails or the virtual camera not working, ping @gxalpha#3486 and attach the obs log.

## Reporting Issues / Bugs / Improvements

> ðŸš€ Wonder How to contribute? Have look at our [notes for contributors](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

This plugin is still very much a work in progress. If you are having an issue there's a good chance someone has already run into the same thing. Please search past [issues](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/issues) before reporting a new one.

Also please confirm that your issue is related to this plugin and not a general OBS problem before opening an issue â€“ try to build OBS locally (but not this plugin) and see if the issue persists. If it does, please don't open an issue here; Instead go open an issue on [obsproject/obs-studio](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/issues). The same goes for supporting other plugins; it's outside of the scope of this project to tell you how to build other OBS plugins (e.g. Browser Source, Speex, etc).

If you still believe you have found an unreported issue related to this plugin, please open an issue! When you do, include any relevant terminal log, crash log, screen recording and/or screenshots.

## Installing
To use this plugin, you'll first need to download and install OBS from the [official website](https://obsproject.com). 
After this, download [the installer](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/suites/675004159/artifacts/6141410) from the [recent build](https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/runs/667183004?check_suite_focus=true), unzip it, and follow the instructions. It will promt you enter your admin password. If you're already running OBS, make sure to restart it. You'll also need restart any app that was running during the installation process that is supposed to pick up the camera. Now you should be good to go!\
To start the virtual camera, go (in OBS) to `Tools`â†’`Start Virtual Camera`.


### Building

If you want to clone and build OBS locally, follow these steps and then run your local build of OBS:\
_This is not recommended if your unfamiliar with the steps below. Most users should just use the installer above._

```bash
# Clone and build OBS
git clone --recursive https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio.git
cd obs-studio

# Follow normal OBS build steps
brew install FFmpeg x264 Qt5 cmake mbedtls swig
mkdir build
cd build
# Note: if you installed homebrew to a custom location, this will be $BREW_INSTALL_PATH/opt/qt
export QTDIR=/usr/local/opt/qt
cmake .. && make -j

# Clone this repo
cd ../..
git clone https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam.git
cd obs-mac-virtualcam

# Set an environment variable that points to the directory for your OBS clone
export OBS_DIR=$PWD/../obs-studio

# Build the plugin
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR:STRING=$OBS_DIR/libobs -DLIBOBS_LIB:STRING=$OBS_DIR/build/libobs/libobs.dylib -DOBS_FRONTEND_LIB:STRING=$OBS_DIR/build/UI/obs-frontend-api/libobs-frontend-api.dylib -DQTDIR:STRING=$QTDIR ..
make -j

# Copy the OBS plugin to your local OBS build
cp src/obs-plugin/obs-mac-virtualcam.so $OBS_DIR/build/rundir/RelWithDebInfo/obs-plugins/

# Remove any existing plugin and copy the DAL plugin to the right place
sudo rm -rf /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin && sudo cp -r src/dal-plugin/obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL

# Run your build of OBS
cd $OBS_DIR/build/rundir/RelWithDebInfo/bin
./obs
```

Now in OBS go to `Tools`â†’`Start Virtual Camera`, then open your favorite video streaming app (or fully close it then re-open it to make sure it reloads any loaded video plugins). You _should_ be able to pick `OBS Virtual Camera` as a source.

## Development

Please help me make this thing not janky!

### Using the cmake Xcode generator

You can use cmake to generate an `xcodeproj` file to open all the files in Xcode:

```bash
# Set an environment variable that points to the directory for your OBS clone
export OBS_DIR=$PWD/../obs-studio
# Set an environment variable pointing to QT
export QTDIR=/usr/local/opt/qt

mkdir xcode
cd xcode
cmake -DLIBOBS_INCLUDE_DIR:STRING=$OBS_DIR/libobs -DLIBOBS_LIB:STRING=$OBS_DIR/build/libobs/libobs.dylib -DOBS_FRONTEND_LIB:STRING=$OBS_DIR/build/UI/obs-frontend-api/libobs-frontend-api.dylib -DQTDIR:STRING=$QTDIR -G Xcode ..
```

You can then use Xcode to build your binaries (which will include debug symbols). To copy them into the right place you need a slightly different command. From the `xcode` directory created previously:

```bash
# Copy over the OBS plugin
cp src/obs-plugin/Debug/obs-mac-virtualcam.so $OBS_DIR/xcode/rundir/Debug/obs-plugins
# Remove any existing plugin and copy the DAL plugin to the right place
sudo rm -rf /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL/obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin && sudo cp -r src/dal-plugin/Debug/obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin /Library/CoreMediaIO/Plug-Ins/DAL
```

### Debugging the OBS plugin

To debug the OBS plugin (`obs-mac-virtualcam.so`), you can attach the Xcode debugger to the OBS process. This allows you to step through the OBS plugin code In Xcode, go to `Debug` â†’ `Attach to Process by PID or Name...`, then enter `obs` and debug the process as `root`. Then run OBS and you should be able to hit breakpoints set inside the plugin code.

### Debugging the DAL plugin

Debugging the DAL plugin (`obs-mac-virtualcam.plugin`) is a little trickier. You need to attach the Xcode debugger to a host process that loads the plugin. One option is to build another copy of OBS (without `obs-mac-virtualcam.so`), attach the debugger to that process, then add the virtual camera as a Video Capture Device there. You should then be able to step through code on the DAL plugin.

## License

As the goal of this repo is to eventually get merged into [obsproject/obs-studio](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/) (or die because someone made a better implementation), the license for this code mirrors the GPLv2 license for that project.
