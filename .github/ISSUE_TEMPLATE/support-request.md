_Please read the "Discussion / Support" section of the Readme first. Only open an issue if you don't get an answer on the OBS or someone tells you to. Attention: While Zoom says they re-enabled virtual cameras, only certain ones they whitelisted work. Currently, this plugin does not work with Zoom out of the box! See https://github.com/johnboiles/obs-mac-virtualcam/wiki/Compatibility#apps-dont-allow-dal-plugins for a workaround._
